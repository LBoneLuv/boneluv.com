It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into\nelectronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in\nthe 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,\nand more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker\nincluding versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>\n<h2>Why do we use it?</h2>\n<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the\nreadable content of a page when looking at its layout.
