> Netlify Identity + React Hooks, with Typescript

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-netlify-identity.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-netlify-identity) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

Use [Netlify Identity](https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/) easier with React! This is a thin wrapper over the [gotrue-js](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue-js) library for easily accessing Netlify Identity functionality in your app, with React Context and Hooks. Types are provided.

Two demos:

- [a full demo here](https://netlify-gotrue-in-react.netlify.com/) with [source code](https://github.com/netlify/create-react-app-lambda/tree/reachRouterAndGoTrueDemo/src)
- the `example` folder here has [a demo hosted here](https://react-netlify-identity.netlify.com) with [deploy logs here](https://app.netlify.com/sites/react-netlify-identity/deploys)

**This library is not officially maintained by Netlify.** This is written by swyx for his own use (and others with like minds üòé) and will be maintained as a personal project unless formally adopted by Netlify. See below for official alternatives.

## List of Alternatives

**Lowest level JS Library**: If you want to use the official Javascript bindings to GoTrue, Netlify's underlying Identity service written in Go, use https://github.com/netlify/gotrue-js

**React bindings**: If you want a thin wrapper over Gotrue-js for React, `react-netlify-identity` is a "headless" library, meaning there is no UI exported and you will write your own UI to work with the authentication. https://github.com/sw-yx/react-netlify-identity. If you want a drop-in UI, there is yet another library that wraps `react-netlify-identity`: https://github.com/sw-yx/react-netlify-identity-widget

**High level overlay**: If you want a "widget" overlay that gives you a nice UI out of the box, with a somewhat larger bundle, check https://github.com/netlify/netlify-identity-widget

**High level popup**: If you want a popup window approach also with a nice UI out of the box, and don't mind the popup flow, check https://github.com/netlify/netlify-auth-providers

## Typescript

Library is written in Typescript. File an issue if you find any problems.

## Install

```bash
yarn add react-netlify-identity
```

## Usage

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** You will need to have an active Netlify site running with Netlify Identity turned on. [Click here for instructions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/#getting-started) to get started/double check that it is on. We will need your site's url (e.g. `https://mysite.netlify.com`) to initialize `IdentityContextProvider`.

**When you call useIdentityContext()**, you can destructure these variables and methods:

- `user: User`
- `setUser`: directly set the user object. Not advised; use carefully!! mostly you should use the methods below
- `isConfirmedUser: boolean`: if they have confirmed their email
- `isLoggedIn: boolean`: if the user is logged in
- `signupUser(email: string, password: string, data: Object)`
- `loginUser(email: string, password: string, remember: Boolean)` - we default the `remember` term to `true` since you'll usually want to remember the session in localStorage. set it to false if you need to
- `logoutUser()`
- `requestPasswordRecovery(email: string)`
- `recoverAccount(token: string, remember?: boolean | undefined)`
- `updateUser(fields: { data: object })`
- `getFreshJWT()`
- `authedFetch(endpoint: string, obj = {})` (a thin axios-like wrapper over `fetch` that has the user's JWT attached, for convenience pinging Netlify Functions with Netlify Identity)

```tsx
import React from 'react';

import { IdentityContextProvider } from 'react-netlify-identity';

function App() {
  const url = 'https://your-identity-instance.netlify.com/'; // supply the url of your Netlify site instance. VERY IMPORTANT. no point putting in env var since this is public anyway
  return (
    <IdentityContextProvider url={url}>
      {/* rest of your app */}
    </IdentityContextProvider>
  );
}
```

## Lower level API: `useNetlifyIdentity`

If you'd like to handle your own context yourself, you can use this library as a hook as well:

```tsx
function useNetlifyIdentity(
  url: string,
  onAuthChange: authChangeParam = () => {},
  enableRunRoutes: boolean = true
): ReactNetlifyIdentityAPI;
```

the library watches for and handles confirmation routes by default. If you don't like this, pass `enableRunRoutes: false`. This was added here https://github.com/sw-yx/react-netlify-identity/issues/12 in v0.1.8
